# Code

This Readme file describes the Group Code Sections organizational structure and
use. In general there will be little discussion of software dependencies, as
throughout we're using python 3, and assuming the presence of recently updated
anaconda distribution packages.
TODO: we should probably all update our anaconda distributions and specify the
exact version here

# Running the Demo

This section describes the processes that must be completed in order to
successfully bring up our Demo GUI application.

## Collecting Data
TODO: Describe data collection process as combination of manual downloads, and
automated processes including what scripts to run, and how to organize and
stage data.

## Preprocessing data (part of demo application or separate??)
TODO: Describe data preprocessing steps

TODO: More stuff here...
